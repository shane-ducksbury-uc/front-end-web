## Churchill House Website Repo 

### By Shane Ducksbury | u3113923 

This semester I was required to create a website for the Churchill House Building designed by Robin Boyd. The outcome of the site is different from my initial concepts submitted in assignment one, but I am far happier with the outcome than if I had stuck with the original plans. 

The layout of the site is very clean, modern, and exhibits little ornament. This is intentional, an ode to the modern brutalism which also strips away ornament as part of the design style. I feel the aesthetic is very similar to a project such as Medium, where the content is laid out for the reader without distraction. 

The assignment forced me to think outside the box when it came to using code such as Javascript in my work. I have previously gone straight to using Javascript when I needed to interact with a page, but the opportunity to only be marked on HTML and CSS really made me think about what is possible without scripting. Learning the Hamburger Menu using CSS only reenforced that CSS can be used for more than just styling sometimes. I also enjoyed learning more about specificity in CSS instead of overwriting over and over again, and feel this is one of my more carefully designed sites yet. 

Having to rethink my designs for mobile late in the implementation progress also reminds me to return to the ‘mobile first’ mindset of web design for my next page. I ended up throwing out an implementation for a gallery because I wasn’t happy with its layout on a mobile page. If I had started on mobile first, I may have come up with a better implementation to start with which would have saved time. I also learned a valuable lesson in double checking the HTML when CSS isn’t working. I had forgotten on one page to add in the viewport meta tags, leaving me scratching my head for a long time as to why the CSS wasn’t working for responsiveness on that one page.

I used a lot of resources, but did tend to come back to the same ones quite often: 

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
Specifically these are always my go to for Grid and Flex – [A complete guide to grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [A complete guide to flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)
I really like Traversy Media’s tutorials for things like JS, and the one I used for the [CSS Only Hamburger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg) is very good. 

[Mozilla Web Docs (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
Mozilla’s Web Docs are usually very complete and instructive. 

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) 
W3Schools is not bad, but I like how they have the links down the side to find everything a little easier when you are looking for similar CSS things.
